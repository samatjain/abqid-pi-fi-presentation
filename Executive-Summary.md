Pi-Fi is a pre-seed stage startup business based out of Albuquerque, NM.
The business was formed in early 2014 during the Albuquerque Startup Weekend.
The for-profit company is developing a product which allows parents to encourage and reinforce classroom skills by rewarding their children with internet time.

The concept is simple: in order to access the internet, a child must first correctly answer educational questions, which earn him or her time online.
The product is an internet-connected router which itself connects to an existing home network.
The child's wifi device connects to the Pi-Fi router and after connecting to the router, the questions are displayed.
Correct answers reward the child with a working internet connection for a specified amount of time.
This works in much the same way that a wireless captive screen works at coffee shops, hotels, and airports.

Pi-Fi is in the prototype stage of its product development lifecycle and is actively working to produce several units for initial customer validation.
The overall design is a router running the Pi-Fi service.
The prototype Pi-Fi router has a simple interface that allows a child the basic functionality of answering three questions and earning 30 minutes of internet time.
Future software improvements include, but are not limited to, options for different question sets, including the type and style of questions, a kid-friendly interface, a login screen for the child, options for parents including content filtering, and performance tracking.

Pi-Fi has two primary target markets for customer validation and eventual marketing.
Both groups are parents (predominantly mothers), who have at least one child in the 8-14 year-old age, an active internet connection at home, and sufficient disposable income.
The difference between the two groups is parental involvement.

The first target market is parents of public school children who are interested in a solution that prevents their child from freely accessing the internet.
This group is anticipated to have a lower involvement in the Pi-Fi system, will have access to the data from the child's performance, but not likely to act on it.
The plug-and-play and convenience features are anticipated to be selling points.
 
The second target market is parents of charter school or home schooled children who want a solution that reinforces classroom learning with more managed availability of the internet.
These parents are likely to have a much higher involvement with Pi-Fi and want customizable feature to tailor the system to the child's needs.
The ability to choose question sets, set goals, change the number of questions, the amount of time earned, and view data analytics are expected to be the largest draws for this group.

Pi-Fi has a straightforward revenue model.
Routers are commodity inputs and are sold to the customer at or near cost, at approximately $30.
These are a one-time purchase for the customer.
Pi-Fi plans to earn the majority of the company's revenue by selling monthly subscriptions to the Pi-Fi service.
The service provides access to the suite of questions, dashboard, and analytics.
These subscriptions are planned in the $10 to $20 price point, automatically be billed monthly to a credit card, and each subscription will service a single household regardless of the number of users.

The market that Pi-Fi wants to enter has expansive opportunities.
The United States market has approximately 40.6 million households with children who use the internet.
The parental control market grew to $1 billion in 2013, and is expected to double by 2018.
The Pi-Fi team has actively researched competing products and other market threats.
There is a single direct competitor named Kudoso, and other product that exclusively manage content, but not access.
The team believes the market is large enough to expand both products.

Pi-Fi's competitive advantage is the simplicity of the business (subscriptions) and product (plug-and-play) models, the cloud-based service, the ability to expand the product's offerings and utility.
The company faces several weaknesses including developing customer awareness, assessing customer validation, and ensuring a bullet proof and robust system.

The initial run of Pi-Fi products used in customer validation can be completed within a month.
The Pi-Fi team has built the proprietary firmware the routers use.
Routers are sourced in bulk, and the firmware is installed on the devices, with all work being done at existing space in Albuquerque, NM.
Pi-Fi expects to be testing this product with parents in a focus-group style in the next 30 days by September.

The three founders form the Pi-Fi team.
The members are Samat K. Jain, co-development founder and the lead developer with degrees in Computer Science and Informatics; Jose V. Trigueros, co-development founder and the secondary developer with a degree in computer science; and Morgan R.
Nelson, a marketing and operations specialist with an MBA in marketing and operations.
The team has worked on several projects before and all reside in New Mexico.
